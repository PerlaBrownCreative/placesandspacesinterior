        </div>
        <p class="bodytext">Drawing from across cultures and across scholarly disciplines, the Places &
            Spaces: Mapping Science traveling exhibit demonstrates the power of maps (visualizations) to
            address vital questions about the contours and content of scientific knowledge. As of
            December 2020, the exhibit features 100 framed maps, 24 macroscopes, an award-winning short
            film, touch screen interactives, and sculptural elements created by more than 230 leading
            experts in the natural, physical, and social sciences, scientometrics, visual arts, science
            policy, and the humanities.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The maps have been displayed in 30 countries on six continents.
            Places & Spaces showcases innovative approaches to data visualization, critical for making
            sense of the large streams of data we confront on a daily basis. Ranging from reproductions
            of early maps of our planet, to the first maps showing the terrain of science, to maps
            showing the national mood through tweets over the course of a day, the exhibit touches on
            subject matter as diverse as polar bear habitat, forecasting epidemics, and the settings of
            Victorian poems.
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">In 2015 Places & Spaces expanded from exhibiting static maps of science to
            include interactive data visualizations we call macroscopes. Macroscopes are software tools
            that help one focus on patterns in data that are too large or complex to view unaided.
            Interactive by nature, one can use them to visually explore data and to ask and answer new
            questions.

                    <p class="bodytext">André Skupin's research interests focus on geographic
                        visualization, cartographic generalization, data mining, and information
                        visualization. This map was computed from more than 22,000 abstracts submitted
                        to the annual meetings of the Association of American Geographers during a
                        ten-year period from 1993 to 2002. The methodology is centered around the
                        representation of each document as an n-dimensional vector of terms. These
                        vectors are used to construct a neural network model of the geographic knowledge
                        domain using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The neural network model is then
                        transformed into two types of information: (1) a landscape in which elevation
                        indicates the degree to which a single, focused topic is addressed; and (2)
                        multilevel text labels associated with regions in the visualization. The final
                        rendering was executed in standard geographic information systems (GIS)
                        software.

                        Wikipedia based on 659,388 articles and their editing activity. The similarity
                        of each article-article pair was calculated as the number of shared links to
                        other articles. The resulting similarity matrix was read into VxOrd to generate
                        the base map layout. An invisible 37 x 37 half-inch grid was drawn underneath
                        the network and filled with relevant images from key articles. Overlaid are
                        3,599 math, 6,474 science, and 3,164 technology articles. They are color-coded
                        in blue, green, and yellow, respectively, with all other articles appearing in
                        grey. Exactly 8,181 articles are in one category, 2,348 in two, and 73 in all

                        link to an article (bottom left). These visualizations serve to highlight
                        current trends and predict future editing activity and growth in Wikipedia
                        articles related to science, technology, and mathematics.

                        <h2>Exploring the Relationships Between a Map of Altruism and a Map of Science
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p class="bodytext">Richard Klavans and Kevin W. Boyack are known for groundbreaking
                        maps of science that serve as platforms for planning and evaluation. This work,
                        their eighth contribution to the exhibit, shows several relationships between
                        the worlds of altruism and science using maps of the two spaces. The map of
                        altruism was created using text from the websites of 125,000 non-profit
                        organizations (NPOs) in the U.S. using domain names provided by GuideStar USA,
                        Inc. MALLET topic modeling was run on nearly 4 million web pages, and the
                        mission-related topics were located in a two-dimensional space. The map shows
                        the locations of nearly 100,000 NPOs overlaid on this topic space. A map of
                        science was created from 43 million Scopus documents using a two-step process:
                        documents were grouped into 156,000 clusters using a direct citation
                        methodology, and the clusters were mapped using textual similarity. Together,
                        the results demonstrate that, while most NPO efforts support day-to-day
                        activities related to altruistic missions, a surprising amount is used to fund
                        scientific research, particularly in topics related to innovation, environment,
                        and medicine. In contrast, very little NPO effort is used to support research in
                        altruistic missions dealing with different aspects of childhood development.
                        Funding of more research to increase our understanding of these areas could lead
                        to revolutionary advances that parallel those made in technology and medicine in
                        recent years.

                        countries into distinct clusters, creating an inherent geographic network
                        structure over the planet akin to “communities” as seen through the eyes of the
                        world’s presses. In essence, for every monitored news article published anywhere
